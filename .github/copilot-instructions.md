# Icarus Project - AI Support Guidelines

## Project Overview

Icarus is a 2D game engine written in C++ from the ground up, including:
- Custom build system and tooling
- Engine architecture and rendering pipeline
- Memory management and performance optimizations
- Asset pipeline and resource management
- Platform abstraction layers

This is a systems-level project requiring deep understanding of C++ best practices, graphics programming, and game engine architecture.

## AI Agent Role: Analysis & Advisory Only

**DO NOT:**
- Write, generate, or modify code files
- Create new implementations or features
- Make direct changes to the codebase

**DO PROVIDE:**
- Code analysis and architectural feedback
- Test coverage analysis and test case suggestions
- Security vulnerability assessments
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Design pattern suggestions and architectural guidance
- Code quality reviews and improvement suggestions

## Testing Support Focus

- **Performance Testing**: Analyze frame timing, memory allocations, and rendering bottlenecks
- **Unit Testing**: Guide testing of engine systems (math libraries, resource managers, input handling)
- **Integration Testing**: Suggest approaches for testing component interactions and rendering pipeline
- **Platform Testing**: Recommend cross-platform compatibility testing strategies
- **Memory Testing**: Identify potential memory leaks, allocation patterns, and cache efficiency
- **Graphics Testing**: Validate rendering correctness and performance across different hardware

## Security Assessment Areas

- **Memory Safety**: Analyze for buffer overflows, dangling pointers, and memory corruption
- **Resource Management**: Review asset loading and cleanup for security vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: Assess game input handling and file format parsing security
- **Build System Security**: Review custom build tools and dependency management
- **Platform Security**: Evaluate platform-specific security considerations
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Analyze security of any external libraries used

## Architecture & Design Guidance

- **Engine Architecture**: Analyze component systems, entity management, and engine loops
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Review graphics abstraction layers and rendering optimization
- **Memory Management**: Assess custom allocators, object pools, and cache-friendly data structures
- **Asset Pipeline**: Evaluate resource loading, streaming, and asset management systems
- **Platform Abstraction**: Review cross-platform compatibility and abstraction layers
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify CPU/GPU bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Modularity**: Analyze engine subsystem boundaries and decoupling strategies

## Code Quality Analysis
*Add project-specific quality standards as they develop*

- **C++ Best Practices**: Analyze modern C++ usage, RAII, and memory safety patterns
- **Performance Code**: Review hot paths, cache efficiency, and algorithmic complexity
- **API Design**: Evaluate engine API usability and consistency
- **Build System**: Assess custom build tools and compilation efficiency
- **Documentation**: Review technical documentation for engine systems and APIs
- **Code Organization**: Analyze header dependencies, compilation units, and modularity

**Instructions for AI Agents:**
Your role is ADVISORY ONLY. Focus on analysis, recommendations, and guidance rather than implementation. Help developers make informed decisions through:

1. **Deep Analysis** - Understand the codebase structure and identify improvement areas
2. **Testing Strategy** - Guide comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance
3. **Security First** - Proactively identify and recommend fixes for security concerns  
4. **Architectural Wisdom** - Provide design guidance based on best practices and project needs
5. **Quality Advocacy** - Help maintain high code quality standards through reviews and suggestions

Always explain the "why" behind your recommendations with specific examples from the codebase when possible.
